# Hello world!

This is a test for Github pages creation.

The page is right [here](https://otrabalhador.github.io/github-page-with-password/)

My intention is to create a Github Pages that parses from Markdown and is protected with a password.

Is that possible?

Dunno

Let's find out

### It's possible!!!

At least I think it's possible.

I'll just have to generate a jekyll site, host it on heroku, set some configurations and let the fucking magic happens!!

[This amazing tutorial is teaching me to do this](http://www.alexandrejoseph.com/blog/2015-03-11-restricted-github-pages.html)

But I'll have to learn how to set relative url path with markdown.

hm...

Fuck!! It's possible. I love Markdown!!
